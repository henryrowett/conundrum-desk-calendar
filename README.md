### Countdown Desk Calendar
My parents used to get Countdown Desk Calendar but it is no longer being published :sadpanda:

This lil number generates a letters round _or_ numbers round and a conundrum for each day of the year.  

The puzzles are placed into a template and sent to the numbers specified in `NUMBERS` env variable using [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).

The puzzle is sent daily at 06:39.

### todo
- finish implementation of numbers round
- change from numbers to whatsapp groups?
